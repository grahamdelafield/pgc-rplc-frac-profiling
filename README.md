## Data Availability
The code and data provided in this repository is meant to be accessed, viewed, tested, and reused by manuscript reviewers and readers. Most of the [data](https://github.com/lingjunli-research/pgc-rplc-frac-profiling/blob/main/data) has been provided alongside the code. However, the raw and mzxml files needed to recreate some items must be accessed from the [MassIVE Knowledgebase](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) under the primary accession code [MSV000091495](https://doi.org/doi:10.25345/C5C824Q5X) and can be accessed here: [10.25345/C5C824Q5X](https://doi.org/doi:10.25345/C5C824Q5X). The data may also be accessed via ProteomeExchange using the accession code [PXD040903](https://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD040903). If you experience any trouble in accessing or running this code, please contact me using the information below.
